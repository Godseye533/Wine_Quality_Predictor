# Wine_Quality_Predictor:
# The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Based on various features we need to predict the quality of the wine.

 1.IMPORTING AND VISUALIZING THE DATASET
 
 2.PAIRPLOT TO VISUALIZE THE PAIR-WISE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEATURES
 
 3.BAR PLOT BETWEEN FEATURES
 
 4.HEATMAP TO VISUALISE IMPORTANCE OF FEATURES
 
 5.DIVIDE THE DATASET INTO TRAIN AND TEST MODEL
 
 6.CHECKING THE BEST SUITED MODEL BY CALCULATING THE ERROR IN EACH MODEL
 
 7.TRAINING TO CHECK ACCURACY THROUGH RANDOM FOREST
 
 
 8.NOW LET'S MAKE THE MODEL BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE
 
 9.IMPORTANCE PLOT TO SEE WHICH FEATURES ARE MOST IMPORTANT
 
 10.OUTLIER DETECTION
 
 11.REMOVING OUTLIERS
 
 12.CREATING NEW FEATURES FROM EXISTING ONES
 
 13.DROPPING UNECESSARY FEATURES
 
 14.CHECKING ACCURACY IN RANDOM FOREST MODEL
